            A full stack developer from Toronto, Ontario, with a passion for all
            things front-end. What I may lack in initial development experience,
            I make up for in an unwavering drive, dedication and desire to learn
            more, and to continue to grow my knowledge and skills. Also, with my
            many years of working in the hospitality district, I have
            substantial experience of working as a team, as well as team
            building. I am hoping to bring my eager attitude and past team
            experience into an innovative environment.
